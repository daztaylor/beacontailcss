              EGO Power+ wanted to provide customers across all existing territories - and new ones - with a much better user experience. To handle multiple languages in multiple territories, we built a single codebase that has, so far, launched websites in 17 territories and eight languages. This powerful web development is cost-effective to recreate for launching the brand into new markets. It has been an essential component to EGOâ€™s success, supporting strategic investment into its cross-channel marketing strategy and driving growth across multiple markets.</p>
